# Unofficial Tutorial Of Bevy

[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) is a game engine built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
This tutorial serves as a quick start for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).
We try to keep each part of the tutorial as short as possible.

## Basic

* [Setting Up](./tutorial/setting_up.md)
* [A Bevy Project That Does Nothing](./tutorial/a_bevy_project_that_does_nothing.md)
* Systems
  * [They Are Functions In Bevy](./tutorial/they_are_functions_in_bevy.md)
  * [The Default Scheduler For Systems](./tutorial/the_default_scheduler_for_systems.md)
  * [Executing Multiple Systems Simultaneously](./tutorial/executing_multiple_systems_simultaneously.md)
  * [Executing Multiple Systems In Order](./tutorial/executing_multiple_systems_in_order.md)
  * Executing Multiple Systems Set By Set <!-- configure_sets, in_set, SystemSet, multi-sys in set -->
  <!-- pipe -->
  * Using Local Variables In Systems <!-- 15, SystemParamFunction -->
* Resources
  * They Are Singleton Structs <!-- insert_resource, init_resource -->
  * Updating Resources
  * Removing Resources
* Entities And Components
  * They Are Like Tables
  * Searching For Entities By Components <!-- query one or more components -->
  * Entities Can Have Different Components
  * Bundles Help Us Grouping Components Together
  * Searching For Entities By Optional Components
  * Searching For Entities With Filters <!-- without -->
  * Searching For The Only Entity <!-- get_ -->
  * Searching And Updating Entities
  * Searching And Removing Entities <!-- Query<Entity>, for e in &query, commands.entity(e).despawn_recursive() -->
  * Removing Entities Directly <!-- id -->
* Faster Compile Time <!-- (remove in release) -->

## 2D Rendering

* Windows
  * An App With A Window
  * The Default Scheduler For Windowed App
  * Initializing A Different Window
  * Changing The Window After Initialization
  * Low-Power Windows
  * Closing The Window On Esc Pressed
* Camera 2D <!-- (origin, positive x y) -->
* The Background Color
* Images
  * Displaying Images
  * Obtaining Sizes Of Images
  * Resizing Images
* Transformation
  * Translation
  * Rotation
  * Scale
  * Combining Multiple Transformation
* Texts
  <!-- * (display, anchors, font, style(?)) -->
* Shapes
  <!-- * (different shapes) -->
* Materials
  <!-- * (colors, textures) -->

## Input

* Keyboards
  * Keyboard Input
  * Keyboard Events
* Mouses
  * Mouse Input
  * Mouse Events <!-- (cursor) -->
* Timers
  <!-- * (time, w/ w/o repeat) -->
* Triggering An Event <!-- (exit) -->
* Custom Events <!-- event.rs -->

## States

* Turning On/Off A System <!-- run_if -->
* Using The State Machine
* Changing States
* Monitoring State Transition
<!-- generic_system.rs -->
<!-- derive States -->
<!-- enum AppState -->
<!-- add_state::<AppState>() -->
<!-- add_systems(OnExit(AppState::MainMenu), ...) -->
<!-- OnEnter, OnExit, OnTransition -->
<!-- run_if(in_state(AppState::MainMenu)) -->
<!-- ResMut<NextState<AppState>> -->
<!-- NextState, next_state.set -->

## 3D Rendering

* Camera 3D <!-- (camera position, look at) -->
* Shapes
  <!-- * (different shapes) -->
* Transformation
  <!-- * (parent/children, despawn recursively) -->
* Lighting
* Physically Based Rendering
* Fog
<!-- * (multiple cameras, background, 2d+3d) -->

<!-- * User Interfaces -->

<!-- multiple windows/cameras -->
<!-- gizmos -->
<!-- animation -->
<!-- audio? -->
