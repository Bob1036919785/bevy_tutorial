# Unofficial Tutorial Of Bevy

[Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) is a game engine built in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
This tutorial serves as a quick start for [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).
We try to keep each part of the tutorial as short as possible.

## Basic

* [Setting Up](./tutorial/setting_up.md)
* [A Bevy Project That Does Nothing](./tutorial/a_bevy_project_that_does_nothing.md)
* Systems
  * They Are Functions In Bevy
  * The Default Scheduler For Systems
  * Executing Multiple Systems Simultaneously
  * Executing Multiple Systems In Order <!-- 15, recursive -->
  * Using Local Variables In Systems
* Resources
  * They Are Singleton Structs
  * Updating Resources
  * Removing Resources
* Entities And Components
  * They Are Like Tables
  * Searching For Entities By Components
  * Entities Can Have Different Components
  * Bundles Help Us Grouping Components Together
  * Searching For Entities By Optional Components
  * Searching For Entities With Filters <!-- without -->
  * Searching For The Only Entity <!-- get_ -->
  * Searching And Updating Entities
  * Searching And Removing Entities
  * Removing Entities Directly
* Faster Compile Time <!-- (remove in release) -->

## 2D Rendering

* Windows
  * An App With A Window
  * The Default Scheduler For Windowed App
  * Initializing A Different Window
  * Changing The Window After Initialization
  * Low-Power Windows
  * Closing The Window On Esc Pressed
* Camera 2D <!-- (origin, positive x y) -->
* The Background Color
* Images
  * Displaying Images
  * Obtaining Sizes Of Images
  * Resizing Images
* Transformation
  * Translation
  * Rotation
  * Scale
  * Combining Multiple Transformation
* Texts
  <!-- * (display, anchors, font, style(?)) -->
* Shapes
  <!-- * (different shapes) -->
* Materials
  <!-- * (colors, textures) -->

## Input

* Keyboards
  * Keyboard Input
  * Keyboard Events
* Mouses
  * Mouse Input
  * Mouse Events <!-- (cursor) -->
* Timers
  <!-- * (time, w/ w/o repeat) -->
* Triggering An Event <!-- (exit) -->
* Custom Events

## 3D Rendering

* Camera 3D <!-- (camera position, look at) -->
* Shapes
  <!-- * (different shapes) -->
* Transformation
  <!-- * (parent/children, despawn recursively) -->
* Lighting
* Physically Based Rendering
* Fog
<!-- * (multiple cameras, background, 2d+3d) -->

<!-- * User Interfaces -->

<!-- multiple windows/cameras -->
<!-- gizmos -->
<!-- animation -->
<!-- stages? -->
<!-- audio? -->
<!-- remove systems -->
